Tutorial project to learn GitHub basics

My name is Richard Strong, but I go by Trey. I was a programmer in the Air Force 17 years ago, and am looking to get back into it by upgrading my skill set to more modern languages/tools. I am primarily interested in .net, css and javascript, but am willing to learn anything.
